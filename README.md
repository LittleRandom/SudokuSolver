# SudokuSolver
Personal project of mine to learn multidimensional array, recursion, learn classes and headers, and also to use some I/O streams.

To use, input whatever sudoku puzzle in the form of numbers 0-9, where 0 is a blank.

EXAMPLE:

941000080 
000701040
000300900
006100034
000000000
410007600
008003000
090206000
060000759

I haven't written a function to write the values out to a notepad. But I will.
